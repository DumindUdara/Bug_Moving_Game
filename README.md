# Bug_Moving_Game
I implement Bug Moving Game using my C knowledge with data structures and algorithms.  

In this C code, a simple bug-moving game is implemented on an 8x8 grid. The game consists of a bug represented by the character '2' and a piece of food represented by the character '4'. The bug moves in a straight line until it reaches an obstacle ('x') or the boundary of the grid. The bug can turn 90 degrees clockwise and continue moving until it reaches the food. Once the bug reaches the food, the game is won.
